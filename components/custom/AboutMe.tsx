          I&apos;m a developer passionate about Artificial Intelligence and
          Machine Learning, always exploring how technology can solve real-world
          problems. My journey so far has been a mix of learning, experimenting,
          and building projects that challenge me to think differently. I thrive
          in collaborative, creative spaces where ideas can turn into code and
          then into something people actually use. From full-stack development
          to deep learning, I enjoy pushing myself to bridge tech with
          impactâ€”always keeping things practical, useful, and human-focused.
